## Projects

### Project 1: check if a number is prime 
<a href="https://github.com/Prabin1998/check-if-a-number-is-prime.git">Prime Number Check</a>

To use this program:

Compile it using a C# compiler (e.g., csc Program.cs).
Run the compiled executable.
Enter a positive integer to check if it’s prime.
The IsPrime function iterates from 2 to the square root of the number, 
checking for any divisors. If none are found, the number is considered prime. Otherwise, it’s not. 🚀

### Project 2: generates a unique and secure password 🔑
 <a href="https://github.com/Prabin1998/generates-a-unique-secure-password-.git">Secure Password Generater</a>
 
This program creates a password by randomly selecting characters from lowercase letters,
uppercase letters, digits, and special characters. 
You can customize the length of the password by changing the password_length variable. 
Make sure to store your generated password securely! 🔒
